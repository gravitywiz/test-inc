## Hello!

This is a test to see how merging works.

### This was added in branch Two.

Let's see how this looks when I merge it back into master unsquashed. 

Before I do that though, let's make another commit locally.

## This was added in branch Three.

Now, we will squash and merge.

Before we do that, let us make another commit locally. For science!
